I am a Law student studying Economic Law at Allameh Tabataba'i. I specialize in Arbitration and Tax law. I also do legal counselling, write short stories, teach English to professionals and keep a blog. 
I wanted to write the code for my own website because I wanted to keep my coding skills sharp because in my academic pursuits I try to study like a polymath and do research in the intersection of different feilds, and with AI and all, I think it is crustial to know math and programming, even as a lawyer. 

And this is the repository where I keep the code for my website, since I like to have everything to be open source. 
 
  thank you all for reading this. Oss.
